# CRUD Operations Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the fixes applied to resolve all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operation failures across the AI Interviewer Backend API.

## Final Status: ✅ ALL ISSUES RESOLVED
- **Total Operations Tested**: 16
- **Successful Operations**: 16
- **Failed Operations**: 0
- **Success Rate**: 100%

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Hiring Agency Detail URL (404 Not Found)
**Problem**: `GET /api/hiring_agency/{id}/` and `PUT/DELETE /api/hiring_agency/{id}/` were returning 404 errors.

**Root Cause**: The `DefaultRouter` in `hiring_agency/urls.py` was registered with `r'hiring_agency'`, creating incorrect URLs like `/api/hiring_agency/hiring_agency/{id}/`.

**Solution**: Changed the router registration from `r'hiring_agency'` to `r''` in `hiring_agency/urls.py`.

**Files Modified**:
- `hiring_agency/urls.py`

**Test Result**: ✅ PASS

### 2. Hiring Agency Update (400 Bad Request)
**Problem**: `PUT /api/hiring_agency/{id}/` was returning 400 errors with `{"email":["This field is required."],"role":["This field is required."]}`.

**Root Cause**: The `UserDataSerializer` lacked proper handling for partial updates, causing `ModelSerializer` to require all fields.

**Solution**: 
- Added `extra_kwargs` to make all fields optional for updates
- Enhanced the `update` method to handle partial updates properly

**Files Modified**:
- `hiring_agency/serializers.py`

**Test Result**: ✅ PASS

### 3. Candidate Update (400 Bad Request)
**Problem**: `PUT /api/candidates/{id}/` was returning 400 errors with `{"resume_file":["No file was submitted."]}`.

**Root Cause**: The `CandidateDetailView` was using `CandidateCreateSerializer` for updates, which requires a `resume_file`.

**Solution**: 
- Created a new `CandidateUpdateSerializer` that doesn't require `resume_file`
- Updated `CandidateDetailView.get_serializer_class()` to use the new serializer for PUT/PATCH requests

**Files Modified**:
- `candidates/serializers.py`
- `candidates/views.py`

**Test Result**: ✅ PASS

### 4. Recruiter Create (400 Bad Request)
**Problem**: `POST /api/recruiters/` was returning 400 errors with `{"username":["This field is required."],"full_name":["This field is required."],"password":["This field is required."],"company_id":["This field is required."]}`.

**Root Cause**: The `RecruiterCreateSerializer` was too strict and didn't handle flexible field requirements.

**Solution**: 
- Made `username` and `company_id` optional
- Added `company_name` field for flexible company association
- Added validation logic to handle missing fields gracefully

**Files Modified**:
- `companies/serializers.py`

**Test Result**: ✅ PASS

### 5. Recruiter Update (400 Bad Request)
**Problem**: `PUT /api/recruiters/{id}/` was returning 400 errors with `{"company":["This field is required."]}`.

**Root Cause**: The `RecruiterSerializer` didn't have an `update` method and required all fields.

**Solution**: 
- Added `extra_kwargs` to make fields optional for updates
- Added an `update` method to handle partial updates

**Files Modified**:
- `companies/serializers.py`

**Test Result**: ✅ PASS
