## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation:**

### **Custom Permission Classes:**

```python
class AdminOnlyPermission(permissions.BasePermission):
    """Only admin users can perform actions."""
    def has_permission(self, request, view):
        if not request.user.is_authenticated:
            return False
        return request.user.role == "ADMIN"

class AdminOrReadOnlyPermission(permissions.BasePermission):
    """Admin can do everything, others can only read."""
    def has_permission(self, request, view):
        if not request.user.is_authenticated:
            return False
        if request.method in permissions.SAFE_METHODS:
            return True
        return request.user.role == "ADMIN"
```

### **Updated Views:**

```python
class CompanyListCreateView(generics.ListCreateAPIView):
    permission_classes = [AdminOrReadOnlyPermission]  # Admin can create, others can only list

class CompanyDetailView(generics.RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView):
    permission_classes = [AdminOrReadOnlyPermission]  # Admin can edit/delete, others can only view

class RecruiterCreateView(generics.CreateAPIView):
    permission_classes = [AdminOnlyPermission]  # Only admin can create recruiters

class RecruiterUpdateDeleteView(generics.RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView):
    permission_classes = [AdminOnlyPermission]  # Only admin can edit/delete recruiters
```

## 🔒 **Security Improvements:**

### **Before Implementation:**
- ❌ Any authenticated user could manage companies
- ❌ No role-based restrictions
- ❌ Security vulnerability

### **After Implementation:**
- ✅ Only admin users can create/modify companies
- ✅ Role-based access control implemented
- ✅ Proper security boundaries established
- ✅ Clear permission hierarchy
