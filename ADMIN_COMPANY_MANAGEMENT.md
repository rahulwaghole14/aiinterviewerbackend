## ⚠️ **Security Considerations**

### **Current Issues:**
1. **No Role Restrictions**: Any authenticated user can manage companies
2. **No Ownership Restrictions**: Users can edit/delete any company
3. **No Audit Trail**: No tracking of who made changes

### **Recommended Improvements:**
1. **Add Role-Based Permissions**: Only ADMIN should manage companies
2. **Add Ownership Restrictions**: Users should only manage their own company
3. **Add Audit Logging**: Track who made changes and when
4. **Add Validation**: Prevent users from creating duplicate companies

## 🎯 **Conclusion**

### **✅ Admin Capabilities Confirmed:**
- **List Companies**: ✅ Working
- **Create Companies**: ✅ Working  
- **Edit Companies**: ✅ Working
- **Delete Companies**: ✅ Working
- **Manage Recruiters**: ✅ Working

### **⚠️ Security Note:**
Currently, **all authenticated users** have full company management access. This may not be the intended behavior for production use.

### **📝 Recommendations:**
1. **Implement proper role-based permissions** for company management
2. **Add ownership restrictions** to prevent unauthorized access
3. **Add audit logging** for compliance and security
4. **Add input validation** to prevent data corruption
