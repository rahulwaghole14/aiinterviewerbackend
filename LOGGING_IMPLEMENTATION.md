# Comprehensive Logging Implementation

## 🎯 **Overview**

Successfully implemented comprehensive logging for all actions in the Talaro platform. Every user action, system event, and security incident is now logged with detailed information.

---

## ✅ **Implemented Logging Features:**

### **1. User Action Logging:**
- ✅ **Resume Uploads**: Single and bulk uploads with file details
- ✅ **Interview Scheduling**: Creation, updates, and management
- ✅ **Authentication**: Login, logout, and registration
- ✅ **Permission Denials**: Detailed logging of blocked actions
- ✅ **Text Extraction**: Resume parsing and field extraction

### **2. Security Event Logging:**
- ✅ **Permission Denials**: Role-based access control violations
- ✅ **Unauthenticated Access**: Attempts to access protected endpoints
- ✅ **Login Failures**: Invalid credentials and validation errors
- ✅ **Security Warnings**: Suspicious activities and patterns

### **3. System Event Logging:**
- ✅ **API Requests**: All HTTP requests and responses
- ✅ **Performance Metrics**: Request duration and timing
- ✅ **Error Tracking**: Exceptions and system failures
- ✅ **System Events**: Startup, shutdown, and maintenance

---

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation:**

### **1. Core Logging Infrastructure (`utils/logger.py`):**

#### **ActionLogger Class:**
```python
class ActionLogger:
    @staticmethod
    def log_user_action(user, action, details=None, status='SUCCESS', ip_address=None)
    @staticmethod
    def log_security_event(event_type, user=None, details=None, severity='INFO')
    @staticmethod
    def log_system_event(event_type, details=None, severity='INFO')
    @staticmethod
    def log_api_request(request, response, user=None)
```

#### **Convenience Functions:**
```python
def log_resume_upload(user, resume_id, filename, status='SUCCESS', details=None)
def log_bulk_resume_upload(user, file_count, success_count, failed_count, status='SUCCESS', details=None)
def log_interview_schedule(user, interview_id, candidate_id, job_id, status='SUCCESS', details=None)
def log_permission_denied(user, action, reason, ip_address=None)
def log_user_login(user, ip_address=None)
def log_user_logout(user, ip_address=None)
def log_user_registration(user, ip_address=None)
```

### **2. Middleware Logging (`utils/middleware.py`):**

#### **LoggingMiddleware:**
- Automatically logs all API requests and responses
- Tracks request duration and performance
- Captures user information and IP addresses
- Logs exceptions and system errors

### **3. Permission Logging:**

#### **Resume Permissions (`resumes/permissions.py`):**
- Logs permission denials with detailed reasons
- Tracks unauthenticated access attempts
- Records role-based access violations

#### **Interview Permissions (`interviews/permissions.py`):**
- Logs interview scheduling permission denials
- Tracks object-level permission violations
- Records security events for interview management
