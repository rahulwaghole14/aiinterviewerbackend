        # Allow read operations for all authenticated users
        if request.method in permissions.SAFE_METHODS:
            return True
        # Allow write operations for ADMIN and COMPANY users
        return request.user.role in ['ADMIN', 'COMPANY']
    
    def has_object_permission(self, request, view, obj):
        # Admin can manage all hiring agencies
        if request.user.role == 'ADMIN':
            return True
        # Company users can only manage hiring agencies from their own company
        if request.user.role == 'COMPANY':
            return obj.company_name == request.user.company_name
        return False
```

#### **`CompanyOrAdminRecruiterPermission` (Recruiters):**
```python
class CompanyOrAdminRecruiterPermission(permissions.BasePermission):

        # Allow write operations for ADMIN and COMPANY users
        return request.user.role in ['ADMIN', 'COMPANY']
    
    def has_object_permission(self, request, view, obj):
        # Admin can manage all recruiters
        if request.user.role == 'ADMIN':
            return True
        # Company users can only manage recruiters from their own company
        if request.user.role == 'COMPANY':
