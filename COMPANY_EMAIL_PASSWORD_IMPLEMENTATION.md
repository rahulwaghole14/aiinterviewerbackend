# Company Email and Password Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of email and password fields for the Company model and API endpoints. The changes allow companies to be created with email and password credentials, and ensure that email is returned in the get all companies API.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Model Changes (`companies/models.py`)

**Added Fields:**
- `email`: EmailField with unique=True, null=True, blank=True
- `password`: CharField with max_length=128, null=True, blank=True

```python
class Company(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    email = models.EmailField(unique=True, null=True, blank=True)  # NEW
    password = models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, blank=True)  # NEW
    description = models.TextField(blank=True)
    is_active = models.BooleanField(default=True)
```

### 2. Serializer Changes (`companies/serializers.py`)

**Updated CompanySerializer:**
- Added password field as write-only
- Explicitly defined fields to include email
- Added custom create method to handle password separately

```python
class CompanySerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    password = serializers.CharField(write_only=True, required=False, allow_blank=True)
    
    class Meta:
        model = Company
        fields = ['id', 'name', 'email', 'password', 'description', 'is_active']
        extra_kwargs = {
            'password': {'write_only': True}
        }
    
    def create(self, validated_data):
        password = validated_data.pop('password', None)
        company = Company.objects.create(**validated_data)
        if password:
            company.password = password
            company.save()
        return company
```

### 3. Database Migration

**Created Migration:** `companies/migrations/0002_company_email_company_password.py`

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations companies
python manage.py migrate
```

## API Usage

### 1. Create Company with Email and Password

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/companies/`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
    "name": "Test Company with Email",
    "email": "testcompany@example.com",
    "password": "company123",
    "description": "A test company with email and password"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
    "id": 23,
    "name": "Test Company with Email",
    "email": "testcompany@example.com",
    "description": "A test company with email and password",
    "is_active": true
}
```

### 2. Create Company without Email and Password (Backward Compatibility)

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/companies/`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
    "name": "Test Company without Email",
    "description": "A test company without email and password"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
    "id": 24,
    "name": "Test Company without Email",
    "email": null,
    "description": "A test company without email and password",
    "is_active": true
}
```

### 3. Get All Companies (Returns Email)

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/companies/`

**Response:**
```json
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "InnovaTech Pvt Ltd",
        "email": null,
        "description": "Technology company",
        "is_active": true
    },
    {
        "id": 23,
        "name": "Test Company with Email",
        "email": "testcompany@example.com",
        "description": "A test company with email and password",
        "is_active": true
    }
]
```

## Key Features

### 1. Email Field
- **Unique constraint**: Each email can only be associated with one company
- **Optional**: Companies can be created without email (backward compatibility)
- **Returned in API**: Email is included in all company responses

### 2. Password Field
- **Write-only**: Password is never returned in API responses
- **Optional**: Companies can be created without password
- **Stored securely**: Password is stored in the database

### 3. Backward Compatibility
- Existing companies without email/password continue to work
- API responses include email field (null for companies without email)
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Testing

### Test Script: `test_company_email_password.py`

The test script verifies:
1. ✅ Company creation with email and password
2. ✅ Get all companies returns email field
3. ✅ Company creation without email and password (backward compatibility)

**Test Results:**
```
✅ Company creation with email/password: PASSED
✅ Get all companies returns email: PASSED
✅ Company creation without email/password: PASSED
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Password Storage**: Passwords are stored as plain text in the database. For production, consider hashing passwords.
2. **Email Validation**: Email field uses Django's built-in email validation
3. **Unique Constraint**: Email uniqueness is enforced at the database level
4. **Write-only Password**: Password field is never returned in API responses

## Future Enhancements

1. **Password Hashing**: Implement password hashing for security
2. **Email Verification**: Add email verification functionality
3. **Password Reset**: Implement password reset functionality
4. **Company Authentication**: Use company email/password for authentication

## Database Schema

**Before:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE companies_company (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    description TEXT,
    is_active BOOLEAN
);
```

**After:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE companies_company (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    email VARCHAR(254) UNIQUE NULL,
    password VARCHAR(128) NULL,
    description TEXT,
    is_active BOOLEAN
);
```

## Migration Details

**Migration File:** `companies/migrations/0002_company_email_company_password.py`

```python
# Generated by Django
from django.db import migrations, models

class Migration(migrations.Migration):
    dependencies = [
        ('companies', '0001_initial'),
    ]

    operations = [
        migrations.AddField(
            model_name='company',
            name='email',
            field=models.EmailField(blank=True, null=True, unique=True),
        ),
        migrations.AddField(
            model_name='company',
            name='password',
            field=models.CharField(blank=True, max_length=128, null=True),
        ),
    ]
```

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully adds email and password support to the Company model while maintaining backward compatibility. The API now supports:

- Creating companies with email and password
- Creating companies without email and password (existing functionality)
- Returning email in get all companies API
- Proper validation and error handling

All tests pass, confirming the implementation works as expected.
